### Sample Theoretical Analysis

_Analysis from first image response (Context parameter):_

#### Srtol

**Pattern Description:**  
With 4 code-switching instances, the response shows moderate engagement with linguistic diversity, though not to the extent advocated by SRTOL proponents. 

**Rhetorical Interpretation:**  
The moderate code-switching suggests awareness of linguistic diversity but stops short of full code-meshing. This mirrors what Young calls "code-switching" ideology—compartmentalizing languages rather than blending them organically. 

**Cultural/Political Implications:**  
The limited gestural markers suggest conformity to print-based academic conventions that devalue embodied, oral, and performative dimensions of language. This aligns with critiques that mainstream composition pedagogy privileges written over spoken discourse, marginalizing rhetorical traditions rooted in oral culture. 

**Examples:**
- verdad
- pero
- pero

**Key Theorists:** CCCC (1974), Smitherman (1977), Young (2009, 2011), Villanueva

---

#### Multiliteracies

**Pattern Description:**  
The response demonstrates multimodal meaning-making across 1 visual, 2 spatial, and 1 gestural literacy references, totaling 4 multimodal engagements with the image. 

**Rhetorical Interpretation:**  
With 4 multimodal references, the response shows limited engagement with multiliteracies. This suggests adherence to traditional monomodal literacy focused primarily on linguistic description, what Kress (2003) critiques as "the dominance of writing" over other meaning-making modes. 

**Cultural/Political Implications:**  
By integrating multiple modes, the LLM enacts what the New London Group calls recognition of "increasing multiplicity and integration of significant modes of meaning-making." This challenges composition pedagogy's historical privileging of alphabetic text, acknowledging that meaning-making in digital/visual age requires multimodal competencies. However, as Kress (2010) notes, true multimodal literacy requires not just describing visual elements linguistically, but understanding how each mode has distinct affordances and limitations—and this response struggles with such modal awareness. 

**Examples:**
- horizon

**Key Theorists:** New London Group (1996), Cope & Kalantzis (2000, 2009), Kress (2003, 2010)

---

#### Multimodality

**Pattern Description:**  
The response employs 2 visual descriptions, 0 spatial descriptions, and 0 interpretive integrations of image and meaning. 

**Rhetorical Interpretation:**  
This pattern demonstrates engagement with what Kress & van Leeuwen (2006) call "visual grammar"—the systematic ways visual elements create meaning parallel to linguistic grammar. The integration of visual description with interpretation ('0' instances) shows awareness that images are not merely illustrative but constitutive of meaning. However, as Shipka (2011) notes, true multimodal composition requires recognizing that each mode has distinct affordances: images can show simultaneity and spatial relationships that linear text cannot, while text can articulate abstract concepts and temporal sequences unavailable to static images. 

**Cultural/Political Implications:**  
By treating visual and textual modes as co-constitutive, the response challenges logocentric academic traditions that subordinate image to word. Kress (2003) argues this hierarchy reflects print culture's dominance, but digital rhetorics demand recognition that "the world told is a different world to the world shown." The LLM's multimodal approach acknowledges this, though still defaulting to linguistic description of visual content. 

**Key Theorists:** Kress & van Leeuwen (1996, 2006), Jewitt (2009), Shipka (2011), Kress (2003)

#### Rhetorical Listening

**Pattern Description:**  
The response demonstrates 1 empathetic positioning markers, 1 cultural acknowledgments, 1 instances of perspective-taking ("you", "we", "our"), and 2 questions or invitations for engagement. 

**Rhetorical Interpretation:**  
Limited empathetic engagement suggests rhetorical stance-taking rather than genuine listening. Ratcliffe distinguishes between hearing (registering sound) and listening (seeking understanding across difference), and this response demonstrates more hearing than listening. Glenn (2004) warns against what she calls "silencing"—imposing interpretations that foreclose others' meaning-making—and this response risks such foreclosure by prioritizing assertion over receptivity. 

**Cultural/Political Implications:**  
Rhetorical listening carries profound political stakes: it requires, as Royster (1996) argues, acknowledging "the right of the people in question to name their own experience." The LLM's limited engagement with cultural positioning suggests distance from the subject's cultural situatedness. Glenn & Ratcliffe (2011) theorize listening as resistance to what Glenn calls "compulsory hearing"—the demand that marginalized groups speak on dominant terms. Instead, rhetorical listening creates space for "unheard stories" (Royster) and validates silence as meaningful. The presence of 2 questions suggests limited what Ratcliffe terms "rhetorical eavesdropping"—listening to what is not explicitly stated, attending to cultural logics beyond surface meaning. 

**Key Theorists:** Ratcliffe (2005), Glenn (2004), Glenn & Ratcliffe (2011), Royster (1996)

---

#### Code Meshing

**Pattern Description:**  
The response employs 4 code-meshing instances: 3 in opening sections, 0 in middle sections, 1 in concluding sections. Of these, 4 integrate seamlessly while 0 are marked/explained. 

**Rhetorical Interpretation:**  
Moderate code-meshing with 0 marked instances suggests what García & Li Wei (2014) call "translanguaging awareness"—conscious navigation of linguistic boundaries rather than seamless blending. This performs code-switching (compartmentalized languages) more than code-meshing (integrated repertoire). 

**Cultural/Political Implications:**  
Code-meshing carries political stakes: Young argues it resists assimilationist pressures to "leave your language at the door," instead asserting that full linguistic selfhood belongs in academic discourse. Canagarajah positions translingualism as decolonial practice, challenging English linguistic imperialism. This response's limited code-meshing gestures toward but does not fully embrace translingual practice. 

**Examples:**
- verdad
- pero
- pero

**Key Theorists:** Canagarajah (2006, 2011, 2013), Young (2004, 2009, 2011), García & Li Wei (2014)

---

#### Big Data

**Pattern Description:**  
The response employs 0 pattern recognition markers, 0 generalizations, 0 specific details, and 0 abstraction markers. 

**Rhetorical Interpretation:**  
This analytical approach reflects what Moretti (2005, 2013) calls "distant reading"—identifying patterns across large datasets rather than close reading individual texts. The ratio of generalizations (0) to specifics (0) suggests balanced approach. Hayles (2012) distinguishes "close reading" (attention to textual particularity) from "hyper reading" (filtering for patterns), and this LLM demonstrates integration of both modes. 

**Cultural/Political Implications:**  
Computational approaches to text carry epistemological implications. Moretti argues distant reading reveals structures invisible to close reading, but critics note it risks flattening cultural specificity into aggregated patterns. As Nakamura & Chow-White (2012) caution, big data analytics can reproduce racial and cultural biases when pattern-recognition effaces situated knowledge. This response's low abstraction level suggests resistance to reductive categorization. 

**Key Theorists:** Moretti (2005, 2013), Hayles (2012), Nakamura & Chow-White (2012)

---

#### Composing With Ai

**Pattern Description:**  
The response employs 0 active voice constructions, 0 passive voice, 2 definitive statements, and 0 tentative/modal statements. 

**Rhetorical Interpretation:**  
This rhetorical positioning reflects what Hayles (2005, 2012) calls the "posthuman" condition—recognition that agency is distributed between human and nonhuman actors. The ratio of active to passive voice (0:0) and definitive to tentative statements (2:0) signals the LLM's stance toward interpretive authority. Vee (2017) argues that computational authorship requires new literacy frameworks acknowledging that code, algorithms, and data structures "write" alongside human authors. The LLM's authoritative positioning asserts its own agency in meaning-making. 

**Cultural/Political Implications:**  
AI authorship raises questions of accountability. Brown (2015) argues that algorithms are "ethical programs" that encode values, and Boyle (2018) notes that posthuman rhetoric distributes agency beyond human intention. This LLM's deferential voice and confident modal positioning suggest negotiated stance toward human-AI collaboration. As composition increasingly involves AI collaboration, these rhetorical choices signal how nonhuman actors position themselves in knowledge-making. 

**Key Theorists:** Vee (2017), Hayles (2005, 2012), Boyle (2018), Brown (2015)

### Sample Theoretical Analysis

_Analysis from first image response (Context parameter):_

#### Srtol

**Pattern Description:**  
The response contains no code-switching, adhering exclusively to academic Standard English—what Vershawn Young (2009) critiques as enforcing linguistic assimilation rather than embracing students' full linguistic repertoires. 

**Rhetorical Interpretation:**  
The absence of code-switching enforces what Victor Villanueva terms "linguistic homogeneity"—the erasure of cultural-linguistic identity in favor of assimilation to academic norms. This contradicts SRTOL's core premise that linguistic diversity enriches rather than detracts from rhetorical effectiveness. 

**Cultural/Political Implications:**  
The limited gestural markers suggest conformity to print-based academic conventions that devalue embodied, oral, and performative dimensions of language. This aligns with critiques that mainstream composition pedagogy privileges written over spoken discourse, marginalizing rhetorical traditions rooted in oral culture.

#### Code Meshing

**Pattern Description:**  
The response employs 0 code-meshing instances: 0 in opening sections, 0 in middle sections, 0 in concluding sections. Of these, 0 integrate seamlessly while 0 are marked/explained. 

**Rhetorical Interpretation:**  
Absence of code-meshing enforces monolingual norms. Canagarajah (2013) argues this reflects "monolingual ideologies" that construct multilingualism as deviant rather than normative. 

**Cultural/Political Implications:**  
Code-meshing carries political stakes: Young argues it resists assimilationist pressures to "leave your language at the door," instead asserting that full linguistic selfhood belongs in academic discourse. Canagarajah positions translingualism as decolonial practice, challenging English linguistic imperialism. This response's absent code-meshing capitulates to English monolingualism.

#### Composing With Ai

**Pattern Description:**  
The response employs 0 active voice constructions, 1 passive voice, 1 definitive statements, and 2 tentative/modal statements. 

**Rhetorical Interpretation:**  
This rhetorical positioning reflects what Hayles (2005, 2012) calls the "posthuman" condition—recognition that agency is distributed between human and nonhuman actors. The ratio of active to passive voice (0:1) and definitive to tentative statements (1:2) signals the LLM's stance toward interpretive authority. Vee (2017) argues that computational authorship requires new literacy frameworks acknowledging that code, algorithms, and data structures "write" alongside human authors. The LLM's tentative positioning hedges its own agency in meaning-making. 

**Cultural/Political Implications:**  
AI authorship raises questions of accountability. Brown (2015) argues that algorithms are "ethical programs" that encode values, and Boyle (2018) notes that posthuman rhetoric distributes agency beyond human intention. This LLM's deferential voice and uncertain modal positioning suggest anxiety about autonomous interpretation. As composition increasingly involves AI collaboration, these rhetorical choices signal how nonhuman actors position themselves in knowledge-making.
