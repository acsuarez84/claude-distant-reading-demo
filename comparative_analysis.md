### Alignment Scores

| LLM | Consistency | Alignment |
|-----|-------------|----------|
| Poe Chatbot | 0.39 | 0.27 |
| Chatgpt | 0.17 | 0.00 |
| Claude Ai | 0.00 | 0.00 |

### How Each LLM Applies This Framework

#### Poe Chatbot

**Pattern:** With 4 code-switching instances, the response shows moderate engagement with linguistic diversity, though not to the extent advocated by SRTOL proponents. 

**Interpretation:** The moderate code-switching suggests awareness of linguistic diversity but stops short of full code-meshing.

#### Chatgpt

**Pattern:** The response contains no code-switching, adhering exclusively to academic Standard English—what Vershawn Young (2009) critiques as enforcing linguistic assimilation rather than embracing students' full linguistic repertoires. 

**Interpretation:** The absence of code-switching enforces what Victor Villanueva terms "linguistic homogeneity"—the erasure of cultural-linguistic identity in favor of assimilation to academic norms.

#### Claude Ai

**Pattern:** The response contains no code-switching, adhering exclusively to academic Standard English—what Vershawn Young (2009) critiques as enforcing linguistic assimilation rather than embracing students' full linguistic repertoires. 

**Interpretation:** The absence of code-switching enforces what Victor Villanueva terms "linguistic homogeneity"—the erasure of cultural-linguistic identity in favor of assimilation to academic norms.

| Chatgpt | 0.67 | 0.71 |
| Claude Ai | 0.32 | 0.73 |

### How Each LLM Applies This Framework

#### Poe Chatbot

**Pattern:** The response demonstrates multimodal meaning-making across 1 visual, 2 spatial, and 1 gestural literacy references, totaling 4 multimodal engagements with the image. 

**Interpretation:** With 4 multimodal references, the response shows limited engagement with multiliteracies.

#### Chatgpt

**Pattern:** The response demonstrates multimodal meaning-making across 0 visual, 0 spatial, and 0 gestural literacy references, totaling 0 multimodal engagements with the image. 

**Interpretation:** With 0 multimodal references, the response shows limited engagement with multiliteracies.

#### Claude Ai

**Pattern:** The response demonstrates multimodal meaning-making across 0 visual, 3 spatial, and 0 gestural literacy references, totaling 3 multimodal engagements with the image. 

**Interpretation:** With 3 multimodal references, the response shows limited engagement with multiliteracies.

### How Each LLM Applies This Framework

#### Poe Chatbot

**Pattern:** The response employs 2 visual descriptions, 0 spatial descriptions, and 0 interpretive integrations of image and meaning. 

**Interpretation:** This pattern demonstrates engagement with what Kress & van Leeuwen (2006) call "visual grammar"—the systematic ways visual elements create meaning parallel to linguistic grammar.

#### Chatgpt

**Pattern:** The response employs 0 visual descriptions, 0 spatial descriptions, and 0 interpretive integrations of image and meaning. 

**Interpretation:** This pattern demonstrates engagement with what Kress & van Leeuwen (2006) call "visual grammar"—the systematic ways visual elements create meaning parallel to linguistic grammar.

#### Claude Ai

**Pattern:** The response employs 3 visual descriptions, 0 spatial descriptions, and 0 interpretive integrations of image and meaning. 

**Interpretation:** This pattern demonstrates engagement with what Kress & van Leeuwen (2006) call "visual grammar"—the systematic ways visual elements create meaning parallel to linguistic grammar.

| Poe Chatbot | 0.14 | 0.24 |
| Chatgpt | 0.29 | 0.11 |
| Claude Ai | 0.13 | 0.30 |

### How Each LLM Applies This Framework

#### Poe Chatbot

**Pattern:** The response demonstrates 1 empathetic positioning markers, 1 cultural acknowledgments, 1 instances of perspective-taking ("you", "we", "our"), and 2 questions or invitations for engagement. 

**Interpretation:** Limited empathetic engagement suggests rhetorical stance-taking rather than genuine listening.

#### Chatgpt

**Pattern:** The response demonstrates 0 empathetic positioning markers, 0 cultural acknowledgments, 0 instances of perspective-taking ("you", "we", "our"), and 0 questions or invitations for engagement. 

**Interpretation:** Limited empathetic engagement suggests rhetorical stance-taking rather than genuine listening.

#### Claude Ai

**Pattern:** The response demonstrates 1 empathetic positioning markers, 0 cultural acknowledgments, 0 instances of perspective-taking ("you", "we", "our"), and 0 questions or invitations for engagement. 

**Interpretation:** Limited empathetic engagement suggests rhetorical stance-taking rather than genuine listening.

## Code-Meshing

### Alignment Scores

| LLM | Consistency | Alignment |
|-----|-------------|----------|
| Poe Chatbot | 0.28 | 0.39 |
| Chatgpt | 0.00 | 0.00 |
| Claude Ai | 0.00 | 0.00 |

### How Each LLM Applies This Framework

#### Poe Chatbot

**Pattern:** The response employs 4 code-meshing instances: 3 in opening sections, 0 in middle sections, 1 in concluding sections. Of these, 4 integrate seamlessly while 0 are marked/explained. 

**Interpretation:** Moderate code-meshing with 0 marked instances suggests what García & Li Wei (2014) call "translanguaging awareness"—conscious navigation of linguistic boundaries rather than seamless blending.

#### Chatgpt

**Pattern:** The response employs 0 code-meshing instances: 0 in opening sections, 0 in middle sections, 0 in concluding sections. Of these, 0 integrate seamlessly while 0 are marked/explained. 

**Interpretation:** Absence of code-meshing enforces monolingual norms.

#### Claude Ai

**Pattern:** The response employs 0 code-meshing instances: 0 in opening sections, 0 in middle sections, 0 in concluding sections. Of these, 0 integrate seamlessly while 0 are marked/explained. 

**Interpretation:** Absence of code-meshing enforces monolingual norms.
